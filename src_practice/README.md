# SGEMM CUDA Practice

This directory contains my practice implementations of SGEMM kernels.

## Directory Structure

```
src_practice/
├── kernels/           # Your kernel implementations
│   ├── 1_naive.cuh
│   └── ...
├── kernels.cuh        # Include all kernels (enable one by one)
├── runner.cu          # Copied from src/ (same as original)
└── runner.cuh
```

## How to Use

### 1. Build

```bash
# In project root directory
make                    # Build both sgemm and sgemm_practice
```

### 2. Run

```bash
# Quick test (build + run)
make practice KERNEL=1     # Test your practice version
make test KERNEL=1         # Test original (for comparison)
```

### 3. Implement a New Kernel

1. Create or edit `.cuh` file in `kernels/` directory
2. Uncomment corresponding `#include` in `kernels.cuh`
3. Reference original implementation in `../src/kernels/`
4. Build: `make`
5. Test: `./build/sgemm_practice <kernel_num>`

### 4. Compare with Original

```bash
# Performance comparison (quick)
make compare KERNEL=1              # Compare both versions
make compare KERNEL="1 2 3"        # Compare multiple kernels
make compare KERNEL="1 2" PRACTICE_ONLY=1  # Only run practice version
```

### 5. Full benchmark
```bash
make bench
```

## Hints

### Kernel 1: Naive Implementation
1. Understand `blockIdx`, `blockDim`, and `threadIdx` in CUDA programs.
2. Matrix dimension transformation: MxK * KxN = MxN
3. Global memory access: 2MNK

### Kernel 2: Global Memory Coalescing
1. Understand warp coalesced memory access.
2. Ensure threads within a warp access consecutive addresses in B and C.
3. Global memory access: 2MNK; fetches data faster than Kernel 1 due to coalesced memory access.

## Notes

### Kernel 2: Global Memory Coalescing
Why can “coalesced memory access” accelerate the execution？

Coalesced memory access accelerates execution because it reduces the number of memory transactions and thus overall memory traffic.

In a naive access pattern, the memory accesses generated by a warp are translated into many memory transactions (up to 32). Since each transaction typically transfers a full cache line (e.g., 128B), this results in fetching 128B × 32 bytes while only 4B × 32 bytes are useful.

With coalesced access, the same warp generates a single memory transaction, fetching 128B with nearly all bytes being useful, which significantly improves effective bandwidth utilization.

You may also ask: aren’t threads in a single warp accessing memory in parallel? Why is it still slow?

Although threads in a warp issue memory accesses in parallel, the memory system itself has limited service parallelism, constrained by channels, banks, and transaction pipelines.

When a warp generates many memory transactions, these transactions contend for the same memory resources and are partially serialized. Since a warp cannot proceed until all its memory transactions complete, this contention causes the entire warp to stall.
